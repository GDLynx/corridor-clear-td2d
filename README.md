## Todo 
* Player's sprite can look left/right based key input 
* Player's sprite can look left/right based on device's accelerometer (device-orientation) - done

* Player can "shoot" when screen is tapped/clicked  - done 
* Implement points system - todo 
* Determine if the player shot an enemy or a civillian - done 
* Reset the player's points to 0 if so, and reset the game (such as by refreshing the webpage) - 
* Implement the effect of moving through a corridor (whether the player actually moves is to be decided) - attempted 
* Maybe: The game's speed will gradually increase as the player progresses
