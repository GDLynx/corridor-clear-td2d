# Corridor Clear 

## Todo 
* Player's sprite can look left/right based key input 
* Player's sprite can look left/right based on device's accelerometer (device-orientation) - done 
* Visual representation of player (player's sprite) which corresponds with input - done (for accelerometer) 
* Player can "shoot" when screen is tapped/clicked  
* Determine if the player shot an enemy or a civillian 
* Implement the effect of moving through a corridor (whether the player actually moves is to be decided) - in progress 
* Implement points system 
* Maybe: The game's speed will gradually increase as the player progresses 
* Create/obtain player sprite assets (one image for facing/aiming forward, one for facing left, one for facing right) - done
